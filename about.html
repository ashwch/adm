<h1>ABOUT US</h1><br />
<p>In an attempt to ease students' burden of finding, searching and downloading notes, assignments, notices &amp; books;
we undertook our mini web based project to be a Web Application that provides a one stop solution for students.</p><br />
<p>Using this content management system a student can easily consult various content that ranges from his books to assignments to notices.</p><br />
<p>This content management system is an improvement over the intranet portal that many colleges are using as an information library for their students.</p><br />
<p>This service is available to students at zero cost, over the internet.</p><br />
<p>Better content management systems maybe available at many institutions,
 but this system is for those who do not have an easy content management system in their colleges, for management of different study material. </p><br />
<p>
We are four third year students, who have developed this system. Functionalities include:-<br />
Upload &amp; Download of Assignment</p>
<p>Viewing Notices</p>
<p>
Upload &amp; Download of Books(to be available soon)<br />
Upload &amp; Download of Notes(to be available soon)</p><br />
